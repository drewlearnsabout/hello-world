# hello-world

<h1> My first repo!</h1>

<p>Although this is the first repo that was created under GitHub,<br >
I am currently taking CS50 through EdX and have updated this repo<br >
to reflect the first steps to learning C.</p>

<p>
Here's the code I used below:
</p>

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
